          In the previous post, I mentioned the 6 services essential to wrap up the Tribal Wars 2 manager: data collection, alert, farm, ops and build-recruit services. Before that to happen however, we need to figure out a way to talk to the game i.e. the authentication service.
Core service overview The source code for this service is hosted at <a href="https://bitbucket.org/cn-d/auth-service">https://bitbucket.org/cn-d/auth-service</a>.
The authentication service is sandwiched between the 6 services and the game server.

          Merry Christmas everyone, and Happy Boxing day to folks in the Southern hemisphere.
In the last post, I wrote about the tech I’d like to play with for this project, but never really go into what each of the services does. This prompts the question to some of my mates who don’t play Tribal Wars “does this application need to be this complex?”. Besides getting all the tech in, what functionalities and services should this project provide to the player?

          Back when this blog still ran on Ghost, I added Mozilla Coral Project’s Talk to Ghost, and…
Legit, adding Talk to Ghost is not as straightforward as the documentation. While the Quick Start is simple enough on running Talk on your own server, what they don’t mention is the amount of overhead setup that comes with it. Being a noob to Ghost, NGINX and hosting a blog on my own server made the setup experience frustrating for me.

          Earlier this year, I developed a single process NodeJS application for all the services in this manager (shown down below) and it started to raise out-of-memory errors due to Node’s limitation. This project aims to eliminate this problem by splitting the manager into multiple services.
This blog post serves a documentation for the high-level design of my Tribal Wars 2 manager. The development for this project is not about cheating in Tribal Wars 2 but using the game as a motivator to learn new technologies.

          This is my fresh start to personal blogging. Back in 2012, I was a huge advocate for Adobe Flash despite Apple’s decision to exclude it from the OS’s and remote-controlled toys. So I started flashandrc.wordpress.com. After a while, my interests grew past Adobe Flash and remote-controlled helicopters, and evolved onto transcribing music that I like and making electronics. Soon, my blog became the go-to knowledge base for ThinkPad keyboards and Machinarium bossa nova guitar piece transcription.

          Low-key, Machinarium was my favourite iPad game. It was an adventure-collecting game, where a little robot with his extendable arms and legs, going around his little world to collect items to help out his friend (I think, it’s been a while). In this one particular scene, when the robot enters a bar, there is this beautiful bossa nova piece. After a few fruitless Google searches, I decided to transcribe the piece.
