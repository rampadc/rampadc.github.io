      <description>Low-key, Machinarium was my favourite iPad game. It was an adventure-collecting game, where a little robot with his extendable arms and legs, going around his little world to collect items to help out his friend (I think, it&amp;rsquo;s been a while). In this one particular scene, when the robot enters a bar, there is this beautiful bossa nova piece. After a few fruitless Google searches, I decided to transcribe the piece.</description>
