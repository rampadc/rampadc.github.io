      <description>Sung beautifully by Seven of Nine while she was under the neural link that falsely made her believed she was the lounge singer in the night club Le Coeur de Lion during a holographic recreation of 1944 Sainte Claire in occupied France, &amp;ldquo;It Can&amp;rsquo;t Be Wrong&amp;rdquo; is a beautiful arrangement with a soft accompanied bar piano. Sadly, however, the recording was never released and a part of the song was voiced over by other characters in the show.</description>
