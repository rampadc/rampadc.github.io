      <description>This is my fresh start to personal blogging. Back in 2012, I was a huge advocate for Adobe Flash despite Apple&amp;rsquo;s decision to exclude it from the OS&amp;rsquo;s and remote-controlled toys. So I started flashandrc.wordpress.com. After a while, my interests grew past Adobe Flash and remote-controlled helicopters, and evolved onto transcribing music that I like and making electronics. Soon, my blog became the go-to knowledge base for ThinkPad keyboards and Machinarium bossa nova guitar piece transcription.</description>
