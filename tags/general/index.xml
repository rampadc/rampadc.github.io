      <description>Did you know that Australia has a ‘Safer Internet Day’? It was on the 11th of February this year (2020). Not only is it local, it’s international. Celebrated in 150 countries, and coordinated by the joint Insafe/INHOPE network, with the EU commission, Australia promotes Safer Internet Day to encourage YOU to start the chat about online safety with your community.
I first came across this day in a Westpac blog post ‘Every home needs a CISO’, written by Richard Johnson - Westpac Group’s Chief Information Security Officer (CISO).</description>

      <description>This is my fresh start to personal blogging. Back in 2012, I was a huge advocate for Adobe Flash despite Apple&amp;rsquo;s decision to exclude it from the OS&amp;rsquo;s and remote-controlled toys. So I started flashandrc.wordpress.com. After a while, my interests grew past Adobe Flash and remote-controlled helicopters, and evolved onto transcribing music that I like and making electronics. Soon, my blog became the go-to knowledge base for ThinkPad keyboards and Machinarium bossa nova guitar piece transcription.</description>
