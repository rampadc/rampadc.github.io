<p>Did you know that Australia has a ‘Safer Internet Day’? Yes, it was on the 11th of February this year (2020). Not only is it local, it’s international. Celebrated in 150 countries, and coordinated by the joint Insafe/INHOPE network, with the EU commission, Australia promotes <code>Safer Internet Day</code> to encourage YOU to start the chat about online safety with your community.</p>

<p>I first came across this day in a Westpac blog post <a href="https://www.westpac.com.au/news/in-depth/2020/02/every-home-needs-a-ciso/">‘Every home needs a CISO’</a>, written by Richard Johnson - Westpac Group’s Chief Information Security Officer (CISO). In his post, Richard talked about a research from <a href="https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/">IBM X-Force Exchange</a> discovering a wave of spam e-mails designed to trick people into opening a notice about protection measures against corona virus, which if opened, will infect their smartphone and computer with malicious software that steals personal data.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Leveraging worldwide events in this way [notice about protection measures against corona virus] is becoming more frequent and regrettably can be relatively successful by preying on people’s anxieties.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Richard, as a father to a family of four children, recommended that all parents should:</p>

<ul>
<li>Stay vigilant</li>
<li>Establishing a set of rules around acceptable use of tech</li>
<li>Take an interest on what their kids are doing online</li>
<li>Try to create an environment where they are comfortable to come and talk to Richard and his wife if something happens</li>
</ul>

<p>As a millennial born into a middle-class family whose parents did office jobs where the most technical activity was Microsoft Office Word, I have found this role to be reversed. I want to give my parents as much freedom as possible, take 0 interest what they are doing online while ensuring that they are browsing in a safe environment, i.e. my parents can trust that when they do their internet banking, people on the LAN isn’t snooping their data. So, how do you help your parents be safe online and become your own CISO?</p>

<h2 id="address-misinformation">Address misinformation</h2>

<p>Corona virus is trending, both physically and online. Know the facts, make sure they are getting the best information about the novel corona virus from trusted parties like the <a href="https://www.health.gov.au/health-topics/novel-coronavirus-2019-ncov">Australian Department of Health</a> and the <a href="https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019">World Health Organisation</a>. Ensure that they fact-check what they read from more than one source of information and don’t click on any links they share on your common social media communications platform.</p>

<h2 id="protect-your-trusted-device">Protect your trusted device</h2>

<p>Ben Dechrai, an avid developer advocate from Auth0, recently <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOVeChWol_s">shared</a> how he segment his home network into multiple VLANs: a trusted VLAN (virtual LAN), an IoT VLAN for his things control plane, an isolated VLAN for the things itself and a untrusted VLAN for his guests.</p>

<p>Instead of configuring VLANs, you can also put string up multiple routers connected to a main hub. After years of moving internet providers, I have collected a hefty number of routers. Currently, I have set up:</p>

<ul>
<li>A trusted Wi-Fi</li>
<li>A untrusted Wi-Fi for the renters and the TV</li>
<li>A things network that has access to the internet for a smart sprinkler and the aircon</li>
</ul>

<p>The aircon doesn’t necessarily require the internet, but similar to Ben, I’m having trouble accessing the aircon from the trusted network, probably due to multicasting hellos, maybe.</p>

<h2 id="learn-the-language">Learn the language</h2>

<p>Not only is cyber security hard, it’s also a <a href="https://www.industry.gov.au/data-and-publications/meeting-demand-for-cyber-security-expertise">skills shortage in Australia</a>. At some point in their career, security professionals do certifications like <a href="https://www.isc2.org/Certifications/CISSP">CISSP</a> to show to the world that they can speak the speak and walk the walk. The certification tests for the following 8 topics:</p>

<ul>
<li>Security and Risk Management</li>
<li>Asset Security</li>
<li>Security Architecture and Engineering</li>
<li>Communication and Network Security</li>
<li>Identity and Access Management (IAM)</li>
<li>Security Assessment and Testing</li>
<li>Security Operations</li>
<li>Software Development Security</li>
</ul>

<p>Getting the certification also requires you to have 5 years of cyber security under your belt. But if you’re like me and don’t work in the security industry, the next best thing is to pick up the <a href="https://www.dummies.com/store/product/CISSP-For-Dummies-6th-Edition.productCd-111950581X.html#">CISSP for Dummies</a>.</p>

<h2 id="familiarise-yourself-with-an-enterprise-siem-software">Familiarise yourself with an enterprise SIEM software</h2>

<p>SIEM stands for Security Information and Event Management, like <a href="https://www.ibm.com/au-en/marketplace/ibm-qradar-siem">IBM QRadar</a>, it monitors your networks and provides real-time analysis of security alerts by applications and network hardware. For mortals like us who don’t have a lot of money to buy all the cool packages that come with QRadar, there’s a Community Edition for us to play with: <a href="https://developer.ibm.com/qradar/ce/">https://developer.ibm.com/qradar/ce/</a>.</p>

<h2 id="learn-more-about-other-security-software">Learn more about other security software</h2>

<p>Social hacking - how well do you know your neighbours, data encryption and managing your secrets require different tools, and even tools like <a href="https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/">IBM X-Force Exchange</a> requires a certain level of understanding and familiarity with a security domain. Just reading the data sheets and product information can be overwhelming. IBM provides some training materials that can ease the curve <a href="https://www.securitylearningacademy.com">https://www.securitylearningacademy.com</a>.</p>

<p>While going through the list of available training, IBM i2 caught my attention. Mentioned in Australia’s THINK 2019, IBM i2 is used to disrupt and prevent human trafficking with <a href="https://www.ibm.com/case-studies/stop-the-traffik">case study</a> on IBM’s website, as well as keeping Rochester police officers safer on the streets (<a href="https://www.ibm.com/security/intelligence-analysis/i2/law-enforcement">case study</a>).</p>

<p>While our use cases for i2 may not get to the scale that these organisations are using i2 for, but I’m keen to learn what’s possible and how to achieve it with the training materials provided.</p>

<p>So, what does it take to keep your parents safe online? As Richard Johnson said in his article, “practice good cyber hygiene”. And if you&rsquo;d like, let’s also learn the language, learn how the big boys use security software to secure their organisations and become your own CISO.</p>
