        <p>A long long long time ago, finding an absence of projects on the internet to re-use a ThinkPad T60 keyboard to be used as a USB keyboard, I set out to research, make USB adapter kits and write documentation to this project. It was a success! I learned how to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Hunt down ThinkPad laptop schematics</li>
<li>Design circuits in Eagle and eventually Altium Designer</li>
<li>3D modelling in Autodesk Inventor and rendering in Autodesk Showcase</li>
<li>Send out PCB gerbers to abroad board houses for prototyping</li>
<li>Write firmware for my first ever first USB microcontroller MSP430F5510</li>
<li>Develop a <a href="https://github.com/rampadc/cc254x-hidKbdM">HID bridge firmware</a> for Bluetooth 4.0 CC2541 chips to use cheap HM-10 modules as a cheap alternative to RN-42, albeit a lot of bugs and pretty much non-usable in production - so practically useless - good learning experience though</li>
</ul>
<p>On the downside, it was extremely costly for me at the time to <a href="https://www.eevblog.com/forum/beginners/parts-sourcing-help/">cash out $700</a> to buy 50 AA01B-S040VA1-R3000 receptacles to connect up the T60 keyboard.  So after the final prototype v0.6, with many PCBs to spare, I decided to sell them on Tindie. Started off slow, but there were so many people around the world (and here in Australia as well!) who helped me recover the costs.</p>
<p>Fast forward 5 years, Felix Klee, one of my first supporter from Germany, reached out and and offered to cover the materials R&amp;D costs to develop a customisable Bluetooth controller for his ThinkPad X41 keyboard.</p>
<p>With lessons learned from the previous iteration, the plan today is to build this with reusable components with support from a wide community</p>
<ul>
<li>Firmware: QMK or TMK core with Microchip AT90USB</li>
<li>Bluetooth: RN-42 or custom Bluetooth HID firmware on a certified module</li>
<li>Separate out the USB+Bluetooth controller into a solderable SOM for reusablity</li>
</ul>
<p>Completion ETA? Probably October 2019. Stay tuned!</p>
