    <p>This is my fresh start to personal blogging. Back in 2012, I was a huge advocate for Adobe Flash despite Apple&rsquo;s decision to exclude it from the OS&rsquo;s and remote-controlled toys. So I started <a href="https://flashandrc.wordpress.com">flashandrc.wordpress.com</a>. After a while, my interests grew past Adobe Flash and remote-controlled helicopters, and evolved onto transcribing music that I like and making electronics. Soon, my blog became the go-to knowledge base for ThinkPad keyboards and Machinarium bossa nova guitar piece transcription.</p>

<p>But I wanted to post so much more, like all these games secrets I discovered and a bit of an integration piece I put together. I want to show off to the world my recent discoveries, maybe run an application server of sorts behind the scene and route a path to that.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll try to write well. I hope you have a good time reading.</p>
