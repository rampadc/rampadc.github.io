      The advent of Docker changed the way we develop applications. Once you had written a Dockerfile and built the image, your application will run (almost) anywhere, regardless of the underlying operating system, and best of all, it just works. You can then expose ports, map volumes to persist data and deploy your image in Docker Swarm or Kubernetes (K8s). With great flexibility, however, comes greater costs, whether that is increased developer&rsquo;s skillset requirements and time spent on writing multiple K8s YAML config files, or pricier services on your favourite cloud provider.

      A long long long time ago, finding an absence of projects on the internet to re-use a ThinkPad T60 keyboard to be used as a USB keyboard, I set out to research, make USB adapter kits and write documentation to this project. It was a success! I learned how to:
 Hunt down ThinkPad laptop schematics Design circuits in Eagle and eventually Altium Designer 3D modelling in Autodesk Inventor and rendering in Autodesk Showcase Send out PCB gerbers to abroad board houses for prototyping Write firmware for my first ever first USB microcontroller MSP430F5510 Develop a HID bridge firmware for Bluetooth 4.

      In the previous post, I mentioned the 6 services essential to wrap up the Tribal Wars 2 manager: data collection, alert, farm, ops and build-recruit services. Before that to happen however, we need to figure out a way to talk to the game i.e. the authentication service.
Core service overview The source code for this service is hosted at <a href="https://bitbucket.org/cn-d/auth-service">https://bitbucket.org/cn-d/auth-service</a>.
The authentication service is sandwiched between the 6 services and the game server.

      Merry Christmas everyone, and Happy Boxing day to folks in the Southern hemisphere.
In the last post, I wrote about the tech I&rsquo;d like to play with for this project, but never really go into what each of the services does. This prompts the question to some of my mates who don&rsquo;t play Tribal Wars &ldquo;does this application need to be this complex?&rdquo;. Besides getting all the tech in, what functionalities and services should this project provide to the player?

      Back when this blog still ran on Ghost, I added Mozilla Coral Project&rsquo;s Talk to Ghost, and&hellip;
Legit, adding Talk to Ghost is not as straightforward as the documentation. While the Quick Start is simple enough on running Talk on your own server, what they don&rsquo;t mention is the amount of overhead setup that comes with it. Being a noob to Ghost, NGINX and hosting a blog on my own server made the setup experience frustrating for me.

      Earlier this year, I developed a single process NodeJS application for all the services in this manager (shown down below) and it started to raise out-of-memory errors due to Node&rsquo;s limitation. This project aims to eliminate this problem by splitting the manager into multiple services.
This blog post serves a documentation for the high-level design of my Tribal Wars 2 manager. The development for this project is not about cheating in Tribal Wars 2 but using the game as a motivator to learn new technologies.

      This is my fresh start to personal blogging. Back in 2012, I was a huge advocate for Adobe Flash despite Apple&rsquo;s decision to exclude it from the OS&rsquo;s and remote-controlled toys. So I started flashandrc.wordpress.com. After a while, my interests grew past Adobe Flash and remote-controlled helicopters, and evolved onto transcribing music that I like and making electronics. Soon, my blog became the go-to knowledge base for ThinkPad keyboards and Machinarium bossa nova guitar piece transcription.
