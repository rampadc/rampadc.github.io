        <h1>Tribal Wars 2 Manager - Architecture - Thu, Dec 20, 2018</h1>
    </div>
    <p class="lead"></p>
    

<p>Earlier this year, I developed a single process NodeJS application for all the services in this manager (shown down below) and it started to raise out-of-memory errors due to Node&rsquo;s limitation. This project aims to eliminate this problem by splitting the manager into multiple services.</p>

<p>This blog post serves a documentation for the high-level design of my Tribal Wars 2 manager. The development for this project is not about cheating in Tribal Wars 2 but using the game as a motivator to learn new technologies. As of the published date of this post, this project is not open-source as it is still in development.</p>

<h1 id="how-the-game-works">How the game works</h1>

<p>Behind the scenes, Tribal Wars 2, henceforth referred to as TW2, uses a web socket implementation Socket.IO to communicate between the game GUI and server. At the time of this post December 2018, the game is using <a href="http://socket.io">Socket.IO</a> version 2.0. To connect to the game, I am using <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/socket.io-client">socket.io-client</a> for Javascript as other implementations of the library is not as up-to-date.</p>

<p>The sequence to establish a connection to the game is as follows:</p>

<ol>
<li>Use socket.io-client to connect to the game</li>
<li>Listen to the socket&rsquo;s connect and disconnect events detect when a connection is ready.</li>
<li>Listen to the socket&rsquo;s msg event to intercept messages.</li>

<li><p>The code excerpt below shows a rough sketch of how this works.</p>

<pre><code class="language-javascript">const io = require('socket.io-client');

const socket = io.connect('https://en.tribalwars2.com/', {
query: 'platform=desktop',
transports: [&quot;websocket&quot;, &quot;polling&quot;, &quot;polling-jsonp&quot;, &quot;polling-xhr&quot;]
});

socket.on('connect', () =&gt; {
// socket connected
});
socket.on(&quot;disconnect&quot;, () =&gt; {
// socket disconnected, handle retries here
});

socket.on(&quot;msg&quot;, (messageObject: any) =&gt; {
// message received
});
</code></pre></li>
</ol>

<p>To send a message to the game, the message must contain a type from the game&rsquo;s routing and events keys in the game&rsquo;s loaded Javascript file, and it should have an ID to identify replies to any requests. The game&rsquo;s Javascript file changes frequently with each new release version. When loading the game, a game file usually comes up following the naming convention game-xyz.min.js, where xyz is a string of numbers and letters.</p>

<p>The code block to send a message is similar to the following.</p>

<pre><code class="language-javascript">send(msgObj: any) {
    this.socket.emit(&quot;msg&quot;, {
        type: msgObj.type,
        data: msgObj.data,
        id: msgObj.id,
        headers: {
            traveltimes: [[&quot;browser_send&quot;, Date.now()]]
        }
    });
}
</code></pre>

<h1 id="project-high-level-design">Project high-level design</h1>

<p>Now, with the basics out of the way, there are a couple of technologies that I want to play with in this project. These include:</p>

<ol>
<li>RabbitMQ - originally, I was going with Apache ArtemisMQ since I was learning Kotlin and was going to do a full Spring microservices thing. However, one of my mates was looking for a tech project to try out Jenkins and he&rsquo;s only Ruby proficient. We went with RabbitMQ for its range of client library support in multiple languages.</li>
<li>Elastic Stack - while looking for an alternative to Splunk Enterprise, I came across the Elastic stack or ELK previously. It&rsquo;s like a MongoDB with all the cool bells and whistles; and you can even build a nice custom dashboard with Kibana and/or Canvas. So say a custom game map with player info and achievement datagrid.</li>
<li>Activiti BPM - ops service for sending farms, attacks, defending, back-timing, dodging, etc. usually comes with some intelligence or rules that can be baked in and prioritised by the player.</li>
<li>Anchore - for container security and compliance checks</li>
<li>Jenkins pipeline to build up a docker stack for all services, perform CI tasks along the way.</li>
<li>NGINX - last but not least, some reverse proxy. The player is likely to want a dashboard with information from each service, game data, etc.</li>
<li>Kubernetes - used to orchestrate services in the manager. Personally, I have yet to work with K8s on a multi-node setup.</li>
</ol>

<p>This manager is going to include multiple services: data scraping service, farm service, ops service, reports, trading service and alerting services for when you get attacked and such. They communicate to each other and to/from the game via RabbitMQ. The data is likely be stored in Elasticsearch and backed up to a free mlab&rsquo;s MongoDB cluster.</p>

<p>The following diagram illustrates how services would work with each other. All services will likely to live on a single Docker node, while RabbitMQ and Elastic stack lives on their own separate nodes. I look forward to using Kubernetes to orchestrate the stack.</p>
